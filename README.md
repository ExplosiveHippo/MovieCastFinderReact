# Movie Cast Finder

Many times you're watching a movie and you see an actor (often a lower-billed actor) that you just can't a name to the face. However, often this is followed by "Ohh, they were in that one movie I think". Well this is what movie cast finder accomplishes.

A little app that takes in 2 movies and returns a list of any actors/actresses that are cast members of both films.

I've built this project already, but I'm porting it over to React.
